# Contributing to Comfort Advisor
Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Comfort Advisor.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/lymanepp/ha-comfort-advisor/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/lymanepp/ha-comfort-advisor/issues/new/choose).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make sure you have pre-commit installed and run `pre-commit install`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the [test suite](#test-suite) passes.
